# Waterflow_Generator
 
## Overview
This project aims to find the path of water flow on a given terrain represented by an STL file. The algorithm identifies the highest point on the terrain and traces the path along the steepest descent from that point, simulating the flow of water.
 
## Approach
1. **Identifying the Highest Point:**
- The program scans the terrain data to find the point with the highest elevation in the Z-axis.
 
2. **Path Finding Algorithm:**
- The algorithm starts from the highest point and iteratively identifies the neighboring points with the steepest descent.
- It calculates the slope between each adjacent pair of points to determine the direction of water flow.
- The path is traced until a point is reached where the elevation is lower than the previous point, indicating the end of the path.
 
3. **Data Structures Used:**
- **Point3d**: Represents a point in three-dimensional space.
- **TriangulationTriangle**: Represents a triangle formed by three points.
- Other utility classes such as **MathUtility** for slope calculation and finding the highest and lowest points, and **PathFinder** for navigating the terrain.
 
## How to Use
1. **Input**: Provide the STL file of the terrain.
2. **Execution**: Run the main program, which will execute the path-finding algorithm.
3. **Output**: The program will output the path of water flow as a series of points or coordinates.
 
## Dependencies
